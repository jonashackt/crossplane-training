# 1. Crossplane intro & basic concepts

## 1.1 Crossplane concepts: Managed Resources, Providers & Families, Configuration Packages

Crossplane https://crossplane.io/ claims to be the "The cloud native control plane framework". It introduces a new way how to manage any cloud resource (beeing it Kubernetes-native or not). It's an alternative Infrastructure-as-Code tooling to Terraform, AWS CDK/Bicep or Pulumi and introduces a higher level of abstraction - based on Kubernetes CRDs. 

Literally the best intro post to Crossplane for me was https://blog.crossplane.io/crossplane-vs-cloud-infrastructure-addons/ - here the real key benefits especially compared to other tools are described. Without marketing blabla. If you love deep dives, I can also recommend Nate Reid's blog https://vrelevant.net/ who works as Staff Solutions Engineer at Upbound.

* [Managed Resourced (MR)](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.8/concepts/managed-resources.html): Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs) that represent infrastructure primitives (mostly in cloud providers). All Crossplane Managed Resources could be found via https://doc.crds.dev/ 
* [Composite Resources (XR)](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.8/concepts/composition.html): compose Managed Resources into higher level infrastructure units (especially interesting for platform teams). They are defined by:
    * a `CompositeResourceDefinition` (XRD) (which defines an OpenAPI schema the `Composition` needs to be conform to)
    * (optional) `CompositeResourceClaims` (XRC) (which is an abstraction of the XR for the application team to consume) - but is fantastic to hold the exact configuration parameters for the concrete resources you want to provision
    * a `Composition` that describes the actual infrastructure primitives aka `Managed Resources` used to build the Composite Resource. One XRD could have multiple Compositions - e.g. to one for every environment like development, stating and production
    * and configured by a `Configuration`
* [Packages](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.8/concepts/packages.html): OCI container images to handle distribution, version updates, dependency management & permissions for Providers & Configurations. Packages were formerly named `Stacks`.
    * [Providers](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.8/concepts/providers.html): are Packages that bundle a set of Managed Resources & __a Controller to provision infrastructure resources__ - all providers can be found on GitHub, e.g. [provider-aws](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/provider-aws) or on [docs.crds.dev](https://doc.crds.dev/github.com/crossplane/provider-aws). A [list of all available Providers](https://github.com/orgs/crossplane-contrib/repositories?type=all) can also be found on GitHub.
    * [Configuration](https://crossplane.io/docs/v1.8/getting-started/create-configuration.html): define your own Composite Resources (XRs) & package them via `kubectl crossplane build configuration` (now they are a Package) - and push them to an OCI registry via `kubectl crossplane push configuration`. With this Configurations can also be easily installed into other Crossplane clusters.
